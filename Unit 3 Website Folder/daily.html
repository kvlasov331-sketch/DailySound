        <strong>“sister”</strong>
        - The 3rd track on the album boy , which was released in 2024 and thanks to which the masses learned about such a name as 2hollis. An uncomplicated song with an unusual instrumental, at least that's what it seems at first glance. With each listen, you realize that Hollis is not singing about how much he loves a girl, but an unusual sample and previously unused drums and percussion add an inexplicable feeling to this song. Listening to sister from 2hollis, you just want to turn on the noise reduction on your headphones and take a ride through the city at night.
