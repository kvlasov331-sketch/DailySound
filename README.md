# DailySound

My website is about the music industry, and the main goal of it is to create a community of people who love music. Website will allow people to discover new music and music videos, new artists and read the news. The purpose is to attract an audience to return to the website everyday thanks to the function named 'Daily', where users can listen to 1 new song every day. The 1st page contains navigation and pictures of musicians who were mentioned on the website. The 2 page contains news related to the music industry; all pictures have links that are thrown on the news website. The 3rd page contains music videos in different genres. And the last page contains daily new songs for people, who want to find something new. People can react to the daily song and suggest a new song for tomorrow. On this page, there will be a short description of the song, including the creation story. Also, there is a Mail inside the footer for the suggestion of the following DailySong. The website's colors will be dark tones. All except the last page, as it will be a special page. The 'Daily' page colors will be related to the daily song's cover styles. Fonts will be wide (Montserrat, Kings, Sekuya, Babas Neue). The style is aimed for pleasant to the eye and comfortable design, where people can exchange opinions and listen to music. The logo is the black bear with music lines on his shirt. I chose the music bear because I think it fits the theme of the site.  Website name: DailySound.
